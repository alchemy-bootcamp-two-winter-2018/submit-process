# Submitting your labs

```js
/*
    In summary, your lab work flow simulates how you are likely to work out in the wild:
    do your work in a fork, on a branch, and make a PR to the original work when you're done. 
*/
```

## 💪 Get going with Git
For your Bootcamp: Part Two lab assignments, we will be using the git flow outlined in the [GIT_FLOW](GIT_FLOW.md) document.


## 👌 Ensure your submission is ready
For your work to be eligible for a grade, you must:
1. Be passing our class `eslint`
    - No warnings or errors
1. Have a clear and useful commit history
    - Your commit messages describe what changes occur in the commit

If your submission does not meet these requirements, you will be asked to fix the issues and resubmit.
- To fix the first issue (not passing eslint), edit your code until it passes.
- To "fix" your commit history, comment in your PR what you would change your commit messages to in order to be more descriptive.


## 🙌 Submit your lab
To submit your work you will:
1. **In GitHub**
    - Follow the directions in the [GIT_FLOW](GIT_FLOW.md#Submit) document.
    - Note that you only need one PR per pair.
1. **In Canvas**
    - Submit the link to your PR.
    - Include how long you spent working on the lab.
